#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with mutliple tables to show statistics about the top movies.

SELECT*FROM topmovies;

#1. What are average, max, and min values in the data?
SELECT AVG(year) AS average_year FROM topmovies;
SELECT MAX(year) AS maximum_year FROM topmovies;
SELECT MIN(year) AS minimum_year FROM topmovies;

#2. What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
SELECT title, SUM(year) AS latest_movie FROM topmovies GROUP BY title HAVING year > 2013;

#3. What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)
SELECT title, year,
CASE
WHEN year < 2010 THEN 'old'
ELSE 'new'
END
AS oldest_newest_movies
FROM topmovies
GROUP BY year;

#4. What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?
SELECT * FROM topmovies WHERE domestic > 600 AND overseas > 2000;
SELECT * FROM topmovies WHERE domestic < 352 OR overseas > 1000;
