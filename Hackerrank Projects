SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city), city ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city ASC
LIMIT 1;

10.Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE city LIKE 'a%'
OR city LIKE 'e%'
OR city LIKE 'i%'
OR city LIKE 'o%'
OR city LIKE 'u%';

11.Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u');

12.Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u')
AND LEFT(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u');

13.Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE LEFT(city,1) NOT in ('a','e','i','o','u');

14.Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) NOT in ('a','e','i','o','u');

15.Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) NOT in ('a','e','i','o','u')
OR LEFT(city,1) NOT in ('a','e','i','o','u');

16.Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE marks > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(name,3), id;

17.Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.
SELECT name
FROM employee
ORDER BY name ASC;

16.Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary greater than  per month who have been employees for less than  months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.
SELECT name
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 2000
AND months < 10
ORDER BY employee_id ASC;

17.Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than . Round your answer to  decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM station
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780
ORDER BY LAT_N
LIMIT 1;
